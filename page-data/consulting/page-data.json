For that reason, Agile development is the number one approach at DevScope. After years of experience with software development, weâ€™ve found that agile is the best methodology for delivering anything from a minimal viable product to a full-scale enterprise system. But we know the final decision for project methodology rests with the client and the team, so we are happy to offer Scrum, RUP or Waterfall to our clients as appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Development Stages</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong><br>\nWe want to fully understand your needs before implementing your project, so our first step is to analyze and document your high-level software requirements. With you, we will have many discussions, develop user stories, and document them in our project management tool, Redmine. This process ensures a project vision mutually agreed upon by your team and ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Develop and Test</strong><br>\nThe next step is to program and completely test your software application using industry standard development tools, automated testing, and an automated build process. Using the automated build processes, we can ensure product quality, ensure the quality of the software by running tests, detect coding issues, and enforce certain development rules prior to deployment. In addition, we are regularly documenting the code to making it easy to understand today or years from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UX Design</strong><br>\nOnce we have a clear idea of your software requirements, we then aim to design the best solution. Tools such as Balsamiq, Visio and a host of other aids help us to make sure our design parallels your goals. By project completion you will be well-versed in wireframes, functional workflows, and many other artifacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deploy</strong><br>\nFrom the client perspective, the project really begins with deployment of their custom software; possibly the most important aspect of the whole process. We take the most pride in proper installation, configuration and final performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can streamline your deployment process through Continuous Delivery. Although it is not for every organization, we implement it when appropriate in order to automate deployment to test or production servers.</p>\n","id":"cG9zdDoxMDkw","modified":"2018-12-21 14:58:42"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDkw"}},"staticQueryHashes":["118757218","1853074139","63159454"]}
